# Production Management System for Vinod Rice Mill Pvt Ltd
#### Description:
My client, Mr Vinod Kumar Gheek is the owner of a rice manufacturing company: Vinod Rice Mill Pvt Ltd. In order to successfully process an order, he constantly needs to contact his employees manually through a diverse group of applications and resources, then give that information out to the customer in the form of updates while keeping check that the processes are taking place appropriately and that the quality promised is being packaged.

The proposed solution for this is the following: The employees are to send real-time updates to clients and owners by separating and organizing specific user access rights. Records will also be saved and mistakes can be mitigated through analysis.  The client will implement this software as a form of testing for a short period of time in order to ensure it is effective, it is a phased changeover.
